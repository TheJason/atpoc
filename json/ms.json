changes in MS epidemiology?","qexplanation":"Although the very existence of a latitude gradient has been questioned by some, there is evidence that the gradient exists but has been decreasing over time. Alonso et al found that in studies prior to 1980, for every 10-degree increase in latitude, MS risk increased by 54% in men and 31% in women, whereas in studies performed after 1980, these figures were 11% in men and 15% in women. The overall prevalence of MS is increasing, as is the gender gap. The predicted mean female-to-male incidence ratio was 1.4 in 1955 and 2.3 in 2000, increasing an average of 6% every 5 years. No shift in age of onset has been noted. Most diagnoses of MS are made in people between the ages of 20 and 50 years(mean, 29 years;median, 32 years). Up to 5% occur in patients younger than 18 years of age, and there are patients who do not develop MS until they reach their seventies.","answers":[{"ansid":"18295","arank":"1","atext":"The overall prevalence of MS is now declining","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18296","arank":"2","atext":" The gender gap is widening, such that men now have almost as much risk of developing MS as women do","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18297","arank":"3","atext":"The latitude gradient for MS may be decreasing over time","iscorrect":"1","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18298","arank":"4","atext":"MS onset is occurring earlier and earlier, such that up to 25% of cases now occur in persons younger than the age of 18 years","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""}]},{"qid":"5048","qrank":"2","type":"40","qtext":"Which of the following persons has a low risk of MS?","qexplanation":"Irrespective of latitude, populations of Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites, Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Sami, Australian Aborigines, and New Zealand Maoris rarely develop MS, implicating ethnic factors outside of geography in MS risk. Otherwise, MS prevalence generally increases with distance from the equator. Geographic areas with high rates of MS include all of Europe, southern Canada, northern United States, New Zealand, and southeastern Australia. Persons who migrate during childhood acquire the level of risk associated with the new area to which they have moved.

Short courses of IVMP replaced adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH)as the standard of care after demonstrating greater efficacy than placebo and comparable efficacy to a 14-day course of IM ACTH. Low-dose oral steroids provide inferior efficacy and therefore are generally not recommended;however, some patients do respond to 10 to 14 days of low-dose oral therapy, and some physicians may prefer this approach in selected cases. High-dose oral steroids at doses bioequivalent to the typical IVMP dose up to 500 mg may be an acceptable alternative to IV therapy, but confirmation of efficacy and tolerability of higher doses in a large-scale prospective study is needed. Plasmapheresis may enhance recovery from an exacerbation that does not respond to steroids.","answers":[{"ansid":"18455","arank":"1","atext":"14 days of IM adrenocorticotropic hormone","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18456","arank":"2","atext":"3 to 5 days of IV methylprednisolone","iscorrect":"1","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18457","arank":"3","atext":"Low-dose oral steroids","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18458","arank":"4","atext":"Plasmapheresis","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""}]},{"qid":"4711","qrank":"2","type":"40","qtext":"Which of the following therapies is FDA approved for use in SPMS, PRMS, and worsening RRMS?","qexplanation":"Mitoxantrone is FDA approved for use in SPMS, PRMS, and worsening RRMS.

The AAN has recommended that mitoxantrone be reserved for patients whose MS is rapidly advancing despite other disease-modifying therapies.<sup>102<\/sup> Mitoxantrone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, pre-existing myelosuppression, or cardiac disease. With the emergence of newer therapies, the use of mitoxantrone for MS is declining.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor all therapies, the risk:benefit ratio must be considered and should take into account individual risk factors for worsening disease, alternate therapeutic options, patient lifestyle, risk tolerability, and comorbidities that may influence treatment safety. With the emergence of multiple new therapies, treatment sequencing strategies must also be considered since some therapies may impact the subsequent safety of others. For example, an immune suppressive, such as mitoxantrone, increases the risk of subsequent treatment with natalizumab in a JCV antibody-positive patient.<\/p><\/div>\n                                <div id=\"rightColumn\" class=\"rightColumn col-sm-6 col-sm-6-push\"><div id=\"media1286\">\r\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<script>mediaGetter(1286,'##iosuserID##','##iosPageUniqueID##');<\/script>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><em>Monitoring and Follow-Up<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the patient is started on an initial therapy, follow-up and monitoring are necessary.

Although it was widely anticipated that daclizumab would reduce the activation or proliferation of T-cells in MS, it apparently lacks such activity. Daclizumab only minimally depletes CD25-bearing cells, such that no consistent treatment-related decrease has been observed in T-and B-cell counts.

Thus, there is a persistent need for new therapies in MS, particularly ones that offer improved efficacy, better tolerability, and\/or oral administration.<\/p><\/div>\n                                <div id=\"rightColumn\" class=\"rightColumn col-sm-6 col-sm-6-push\"><\/div>\n                            <\/div>\n                        <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                \n            \n        "},{"pageNum":148,"tocTitle":"Small-Molecule Oral Agents in Development(A)","tocType":"page","tocID":"4015","parentID":"3183","jobNum":"202221404_02_2","jobNumDot":"202221404.02.2","cola":"<p>\r\n\tA number of small molecules have been developed for the treatment of MS.

There is disagreement as to whether any MRI findings alone are sufficient to warrant a change in therapy, but proposed criteria for suboptimal response generally require \u22653 new enhancing lesions, >3 new T2 lesions in 1 year, or \u22652 new T2 lesions on repeated scans performed at least 3 months apart.","answers":[{"ansid":"18528","arank":"1","atext":"A patient who has had a single relapse after 3 years on interferon beta-1a","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18529","arank":"2","atext":"A clinically stable patient on interferon beta-1b who has two new Gd-enhancing lesions on a routine MRI","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18530","arank":"3","atext":"A patient who has a second relapse 3 months after starting glatiramer acetate for CIS","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18531","arank":"4","atext":"A patient on interferon beta-1b who has had two relapses in the past year, from which he has had incomplete recovery","iscorrect":"1","ansvalue":""}]},{"qid":"4729","qrank":"2","type":"40","qtext":"A patient has had a suboptimal response to treatment with SC interferon beta-1a.

Conventional MRI T2-weighted images can detect inflammation, edema, demyelination, and axonal loss;however, MRI does not differentiate between irreversible and reversible damage and is unable to detect axonal injury in normal-appearing brain tissue. Volume of \"black holes\"(areas of T1 hypointensity)on conventional MRI is thought to be a marker for axonal loss, but correlation with clinical outcomes remains uncertain. White matter is composed largely of axons and myelin;therefore, progressive brain atrophy likely represents demyelination and axonal loss.

The &quot;Holy Grail&quot;of MS treatment would be a therapy that not only protects neurons from further demyelination and axonal loss, but also allows for remyelination, neuroregeneration, and restoration of lost function.<\/p><\/div>\n                                <div id=\"rightColumn\" class=\"rightColumn col-sm-6 col-sm-6-push\"><\/div>\n                            <\/div>\n                        <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                \n            \n        "},{"pageNum":277,"tocTitle":"Endogenous Mechanisms of Neuroprotection and Neuroregeneration(A)","tocType":"page","tocID":"3943","parentID":"3189","jobNum":"202221405_02_2","jobNumDot":"202221405.02.2","cola":"<p>\r\n\tThis chapter looks at modern definitions and means of assessing neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and available data on the neuroprotective potential of current and emerging treatment approaches.<\/p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tEndogenous Mechanisms of Neuroprotection and Neuroregeneration<\/h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe natural immune response in MS can be both deleterious and neuroprotective.

In the future, advanced imaging techniques(eg, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetization transfer imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging), paraclinical measures(eg, optical coherence tomography, and CSF or plasma biomarkers(eg, BDNF, nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3), may be incorporated into clinical trials for further evaluation of neuroprotection. Most of the available and emerging MS disease-modifying therapies have shown evidence of neuroprotection in vitro, in preclinical investigations, and on MRI outcomes in clinical trials. Whether radiologic improvements are attributable to direct or indirect effects of these therapies on myelin and axons has not yet been established. A variety of novel agents and stem cell therapies hold additional potential as neuroprotective or neuroregenerative therapies in MS based on preclinical data, but confirmation in human trials is needed.<\/p><\/div>\n                            <\/div>\n                        <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                \n            \n        "},{"pageNum":296,"tocTitle":"References(A)","tocType":"page","tocID":"3972","parentID":"3189","jobNum":"202221405_02_21","jobNumDot":"202221405.02.21","cola":"<div>\r\n\t<div class=\"highlightBox\">\r\n\t\t<h5>\r\n\t\t\tPatient Education:<\/h5>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tFor patient education materials, see below:<\/p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t&bull;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mstrust.org.uk\/atoz\/neuroprotection.jsp\" target=\"_blank\"> MS: Neuroprotection<\/a><\/p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t&bull;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalmssociety.org\/about-multiple-sclerosis\/newly-diagnosed\/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> MS: Newly-Diagnosed<\/a><\/p>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<div class=\"highlightBox\">\r\n\t\t<h5>\r\n\t\t\tOf Related Interest:<\/h5>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tFor information on the pathophysiology of MS, <a class=\"internalpage\" href=\"index.cfm?pagenum=202221402.02.1\" id=\"goInternalPage\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","colb":"<h2>\r\n\tReferences<\/h2>\r\n<ol start=\"1\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDe Santi L, Polimeni G, Cuzzocrea S, et al.

Eliminating the self-injection part of the DMT regimen is likely to improve adherence and potential treatment outcomes, but adherence issues will not vanish just because a patient is taking an oral DMT, as numerous other factors can contribute to poor adherence. Like injectable therapies, oral DMTs are intended to prevent relapse, and have no symptomatic benefit per se, which means that real or perceived lack of efficacy will still be a barrier to adherence. There are currently no long-term data regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral agents;furthermore, side effects vary considerably among these agents. Thus, providers do need to be vigilant with monitoring and supporting patients to ensure that side effects are reported and adherence is achieved.","answers":[{"ansid":"18641","arank":"1","atext":"The convenience of orally administered DMTs will eliminate adherence issues typical of current injectable DMTs","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18642","arank":"2","atext":"It is necessary to monitor for side effects and support patients to ensure adherence even with new\/emerging oral and monoclonal antibody(mAb)DMTs","iscorrect":"1","ansvalue":""},{"ansid":"18643","arank":"3","atext":"Patients will be more likely to adhere to treatment with oral DMTs because of their symptomatic benefits","iscorrect":"0","ansvalue":""}]},{"qid":"4757","qrank":"4","type":"40","qtext":"Which of the following is a strategy that providers can use to optimize adherence to MS DMTs?","qexplanation":"Educating patients about their condition, their need for treatment, potential benefits of treatment, and side effects to expect are important to help patients set realistic expectations. Treatment planning should be a collaborative process that empowers patients to be actively involved in their treatment. Having someone else administer a patient's injections reduces the patient's independence, and dependence on others increases the risk of missing injections and treatment discontinuation. As previously mentioned, educating patients about what side effects to expect helps patients set realistic expectations for treatment.

At the 2012 AAN annual meeting, Macciardi et al reported derivation of a genetic model consisting of six SNPs with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive-and negative-predictive values for glatiramer acetate responsiveness. Most SNPs occur in introns where they do not have a direct effect on gene function. Less commonly, SNPs are located in exons(the coding region of DNA)where they may affect gene function if they change the amino acids that are brought together to make a protein. SNPs located in exons are therefore more likely to be associated with disease risk, and rare SNP variants(<1%)in exons that change amino acids are even more likely to do so. SNPs occur frequently, about every 100 to 300 bases in the 3-billion base genome.

Furthermore, they found that response to interferon was more likely among patients with decreased CD46 mRNA expression(65.9%)than among those with increased CD46 mRNA(44.4%;P=.006).

It is unlikely that such genes, detected using an unbiased approach, such as GWAS, would have identified immune system genes by chance rather than central nervous system(CNS)structural or other genes. This is strong evidence, as long suspected, that MS is a disorder of the immune system. However, the genetic evidence would indicate that the immunologic perturbation is one to which individuals who develop MS are intrinsically predisposed. More clarity and identification of additional associations using GWAS will be useful to identify SNPs that pertain to MS.

It is unlikely that such genes, detected using an unbiased approach, such as GWAS, would have identified immune system genes by chance rather than central nervous system(CNS)structural or other genes. This is strong evidence, as long suspected, that MS is a disorder of the immune system. However, the genetic evidence would indicate that the immunologic perturbation is one to which individuals who develop MS are intrinsically predisposed. More clarity and identification of additional associations using GWAS will be useful to identify SNPs that pertain to MS.
